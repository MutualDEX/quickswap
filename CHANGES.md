The code from this project was originally taken from these three repositories:
https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-lib
https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-v2-core
https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-v2-periphery

Code from the above repositories were combined into this one and they were upgraded to use Solidity 0.7.0.
These changes occurred on 12 August 2020.

The code from these repositories are used as a base for token trading on Matic Network.
